## Barebones App With Login Functionality

(To view the Cloud Run-hosted version of this app, visit https://simpleappwithlogin-dsmxn3zfoq-uc.a.run.app . See below for steps on deploying your own copy of this app to Cloud Run.)

The code in this folder was derived from jinnyzor's post at https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-app-pages-with-flask-login-flow-using-flask/69507/38 . Jinnyzor [wrote regarding that post](https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-app-pages-with-flask-login-flow-using-flask/69507/55): "this is free to use, no license." I am very grateful to jinnyzor (and to [Nader Elshehabi](https://github.com/naderelshehabi/dash-flask-login)) for allowing us to use their code!

Some code also derives from that found in the [Dash Pages documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/urls).

## Steps for hosting this Dash app (with Flask-Login functionality) on Google Cloud Run

<h2 style="color:red">Warning: These steps may cause you to incur hosting charges depending on how frequently your site is visited. I recommend setting billing alerts to keep track of your spending.</h2>

Heroku, an alternative site for hosting Dash apps, offers maximum monthly spending caps, which could help you control your costs; however, it's possible that the minimum amount you would pay on Herkou would be higher than your minimum on Cloud Run. (This is why I chose to deploy this app to Cloud Run rather than Heroku.) Heroku pricing information [can be found here](https://www.heroku.com/pricing).</h2>

1. Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/. (Create a Google Cloud Console account if needed).

2. Create a new project. I named mine 'pyfono' (short for 'Python for Nonprofits'--I couldn't use 'pfn' because it needed to be at least 4 characters long).

3. Follow [the steps outlined here](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service). Note that, if you need to install the Google Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI), you can do so [on this page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). I deselected the 'Bundled Python' component during the installation process since (not surprisingly) I already had Python present on my computer.

I also used the following contents in place of the recommended requirements.txt values:
Flask
gunicorn
Werkzeug
Dash
Flask-Login

(These libraries will be imported from pip. Therefore, in order to determine what format of their name to use, visit the library on Pypi and then enter the text following the 'pip install' example. For instance, on the [Flask-Login](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Login/) page, you'll see 'pip install Flask Login'; therefore, add Flask-Login to the requirements.txt page rather than flask-login (its name within conda) or flask_login (its name within app.py).

(Also note that entering `gcloud run deploy --source .` (don't forget the period!) rather than `gcloud run deploy` saves you a step during the deployment process.)

The [Google Cloud Region Picker](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/region-picker/) site can help you determine where to host your app. (When prompted for my region choice, I entered 32 for us-central1.

4. You'll also want to add a file named Procfile (no extension) with the following text:
web: gunicorn app:server

(This line came from https://dash.plotly.com/deployment)

I was prompted to enter this line after seeing the following error message within my Google Cloud Console log:

`Step #1: [builder] failed to build: for Python, provide a main.py file or set an entrypoint with "GOOGLE_ENTRYPOINT" env var or by creating a "Procfile" file"`

5. Hopefully, after Google Cloud finishes processing your deployment request, you'll see a message like the following:

`Service [simpleappwithlogin] revision [simpleappwithlogin-00002-xdj] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic.
Service URL: https://simpleappwithlogin-dsmxn3zfoq-uc.a.run.app`

To confirm that your page is operating correctly, visit its service URL (e.g. https://simpleappwithlogin-dsmxn3zfoq-uc.a.run.app). Ideally, you'll see the same screen that you would when deploying the app locally. If you instead see 'Service Unavailable', don't panic! There's something about your deployment that isn't quite correct. Perhaps you forgot to include a library within requirements.txt that your script uses, for instance. Make sure to check your logs (available at https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/) for clues as to what might be going wrong with your script.

6. After deploying a new version of your app, you may want to delete the old version (especially if it failed to run to begin with) in order to save costs. You can do so by searching for 'Artifact Registry' within the Cloud Console website; navigating to the list of containers for your site; and then keeping only the most recent container.
