    "# Census Data Imports (Work in Progress)\n",

    "The US Census is a fantastic source of free demographic data. Thankfully, we can easily access large amounts of this data at once via Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that some NVCU graduating seniors are interested in settling down and raising a family a few years after they graduate. Therefore, they'd like to know what parts of the US have especially high percentages of married families with kids. However, they'd also like to avoid having to spend too much money on a home, so they're interested in regions with relatively low property costs. And finally, because they'd prefer to live in a growing region rather than a declining one, they want to know which areas have the highest 5-year population growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, we'll use the Census API to retrieve marriage, home price, and population growth data for all US counties. We'll then combine this data together in order to create a 'Fit Index' that we can share with these seniors."
