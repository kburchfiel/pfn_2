# Python for Nonprofits (Version 2)

Released under the MIT License

In this project, I will demonstrate how nonprofits can use Python to manage, analyze, and visualize their data. This project is still in its early stages, but I plan to add a number of sections to it as time allows.

*Note*: This project is *not* meant to replace an introductory Python course or textbook. If you're new to Python, I suggest getting started with a resource like [Think Python, 3rd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/). (I found the 2nd edition of this book to be very helpful in my own studies.) Once you've finished reading Think Python or have a similar introductory background in the language, you should be in a great position to benefit from this project.

# Contents

Note: many of these sections have not yet been completed or even started. I'm working on this project in my free time (which, as a new dad, is not very abundant!), so it may be a while before I begin or finalize a given section.

## Spreadsheet Operations (Not yet started)

This section will demonstrate how to use Python to perform many tasks for which you might normally use a spreadsheet editor. It also provides an introduction to Pandas, a powerful library for viewing and transforming data within Python.

## Data Cleaning (Not yet started)

In this section, you'll learn how to use Python to perform some basic data cleaning tasks. The section also provides tips on handling duplicate entries and missing data.

## Graphing (Not yet started)

Plotly is a powerful tool for creating both interactive and static charts. This section will demonstrate how to create bar, line, and scatter plots along with treemaps (an alternative to pie charts).

## Mapping (Initial draft complete)

This section will demonstrate how to use Folium to create interactive choropleth maps. I may expand this section in the future to include additional map types (such as maps of points and route maps).

## Updating Online Spreadsheets (Not yet started)

This section will demonstrate how to use Python to export data to a Google Sheets workbook, thus enabling others to view that data.

## Online Visualizations (Not yet started)

In this section, you'll learn how to use the Dash and Plotly libraries to create interactive online dashboards.

## Appendix

This section will contain a Jupyter Notebook that I'll use to construct a SQLite database with **fictional** data for an imaginary university. The tables in this dataset will get used in many parts of Python for Nonprofits.
