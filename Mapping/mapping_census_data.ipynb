    "# Mapping Census Data (Work in Progress)\n",

    "This notebook will demonstrate how to create choropleth maps of data retrieved via this project's [Census Data Imports script](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn_2/blob/main/Census_Data_Imports/census_data_imports.ipynb). As a reminder, we retrieved Census data within that script in order to answer two separate questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which counties would be the best destinations for NVCU grads who are looking to settle down and raise a family? *[This section of the Census Data Imports script hasn't yet been started, but I plan to begin working on it soon.]*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What correlation, if any, exists between marital status and poverty?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we performed some basic data analyses within the Census Data Imports script to answer those questions, the choropleth maps we'll create here will also serve as a useful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: For additional documentation on the code used within this script, consult [choropleth_maps.ipynb](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn_2/blob/main/Mapping/choropleth_maps.ipynb).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive copies of the maps created within this code can be viewed via the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Married household poverty rates by county](https://sites.google.com/view/pfn2-acs-choropleth-maps/married-couple-household-poverty-rate-source-2022-acs-5-year-estimates)\n",
    "\n",
