# Python for Nonprofits (Version 2)

By Kenneth Burchfiel

Released under the MIT License

In this project, I will demonstrate how nonprofits can use Python to retrieve, analyze, visualize, and share their data. This project is still in its early stages, but I plan to add a number of sections to it as time allows.

*Note*: This project is *not* meant to replace an introductory Python course or textbook. If you're new to Python, I suggest getting started with a resource like [Think Python, 3rd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/). (I found the 2nd edition of this book to be very helpful in my own studies.) Once you've finished reading Think Python or have a similar introductory background in the language, you should be in a great position to benefit from this project.

# Contents

Note: many of these sections have not yet been completed or even started. I'm working on this project in my free time (which, as a new dad, is not very abundant!), so it may be a while before I begin or finalize a given section.

## Introduction (Not yet complete)

This section will explain (1) why you should consider using Python at your nonprofit organization and (2) how I put this code together.

## Data Retrieval (Not yet started)

This section will show how to import data into your Python scripts from a range of sources.

## Spreadsheet Operations (Not yet started)

This section will demonstrate how to use Python to perform many tasks for which you might normally use a spreadsheet editor. It also provides an introduction to Pandas, a powerful library for viewing and transforming data within Python.

## Retrieving Census Data (Mostly Complete)

This section shows how to use Python to retrieve data from the US Census API, a great source of public-domain demographic data.

## Data Cleaning (Not yet started)

In this section, you'll learn how to use Python to perform some basic data cleaning tasks. The section also provides tips on handling duplicate entries and missing data.

## Graphing (Not yet started)

Plotly is a powerful tool for creating both interactive and static charts. This section will demonstrate how to create bar, line, and scatter plots along with treemaps (an alternative to pie charts).

## Mapping (Initial draft complete)

This section demonstrates how to use Folium to create interactive choropleth maps. I may expand this section in the future to include additional map types (such as maps of points and routes).

The interactive maps created in this section can be viewed using the following links:

[Net migration rates by state](https://sites.google.com/view/pfn2-choropleth-maps/net-migration-by-state?authuser=0)

Here are static copies of these maps:

## Updating Online Spreadsheets (Not yet started)

This section will demonstrate how to use Python to export data to a Google Sheets workbook, thus enabling others to view that data.

## Online Visualizations (Not yet started)

In this section, you'll learn how to use the Dash and Plotly libraries to create interactive online dashboards.

## Appendix

This section will contain a Jupyter Notebook that I'll use to construct a SQLite database with **fictional** data for an imaginary university. The tables in this dataset will get used in many parts of Python for Nonprofits.
